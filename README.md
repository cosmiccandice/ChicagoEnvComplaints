This Jupyter notebook provides a comprehensive analysis and forecasting of environmental complaints data in Chicago. The analysis is structured into several key sections, each leveraging different data science techniques and methodologies to extract insights and predict future trends. Here's a summary of the entire notebook:

## Spatial Distribution of Complaint Types
* **Objective:** Visualize the geographical spread of environmental complaints across Chicago to identify hotspots and spatial patterns.
* **Techniques Used:** GeoPandas for geospatial data handling and Contextily for adding basemaps to plots. Complaints were mapped with distinct colors based on their type to easily distinguish between them.
* **Insights:** The visualization revealed areas with higher concentrations of specific complaint types, which can guide targeted interventions and resource allocation.

## Yearly Trends of Complaint Types

* **Objective:** Analyze how the volume of complaints has changed over the years, from 1993 to 2012.
* **Techniques Used:** Time series analysis using Pandas for data aggregation and Matplotlib for visualization.
* **Insights:** The line plot of complaints over time helped identify trends, such as increases or decreases in complaint volume, which could be indicative of underlying factors such as policy changes or public awareness.

## Complaint Type Breakdown

* **Objective:** Understand the distribution of different types of complaints to identify the most common issues reported.
* **Techniques Used:**  Data aggregation and bar chart visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
* **Insights:** The analysis provided a clear breakdown of complaint types, highlighting the most prevalent issues, which can inform policy and operational priorities.

## Predicting Complaint Types

* **Objective:** Automatically categorize complaints based on their details using machine learning.
* **Techniques Used:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) for text feature extraction with TF-IDF vectorization, followed by classification modeling with Naive Bayes.
* **Insights:** The model demonstrated the feasibility of using ML to streamline complaint categorization, which could enhance response efficiency. Model evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score were used to assess performance.

## Time Series Forecasting

* **Objective:** Forecast the number of complaints for the next 12 months based on historical data.
* **Techniques Used:** ARIMA modeling for time series forecasting, with automatic parameter selection using the pmdarima library.
* **Insights:** The forecasting model provided future complaint volume predictions, complete with confidence intervals. This predictive insight can aid in resource planning and allocation for handling future complaints.

## Conclusion
This notebook combines geospatial analysis, time series analysis, natural language processing, and machine learning to offer a multifaceted view of environmental complaints in Chicago. From spatial distribution insights to predictive modeling, each section contributes to a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends in the data. Such comprehensive analysis can inform better decision-making and policy development to address environmental concerns more effectively.
